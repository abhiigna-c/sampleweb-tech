    <h2>Machine Learning (ML)</h2>
    <p>Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of Artificial Intelligence that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to perform specific tasks without explicit instructions. ML systems learn from data, identify patterns, and make decisions with minimal human intervention. Common applications of machine learning include image and speech recognition, fraud detection, recommendation systems, and predictive analytics.</p>
